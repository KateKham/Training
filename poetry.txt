Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are.
Up above the world so high,
Like a diamond in the sky.


I can see balls and bats and cars.
I can see boats and planes.
I can see carts, skipping ropes, dolls.
I can see ships and trains.
I can see games and tops and lorries.
I can see bears and bikes.
I can see swings and slides and skates.
I can see drums and kites.
Of all the toys I can see,
I want one for me!
